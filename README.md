The application displays a table with information about the inventory to the user and them prompts them to select the item they are interested in purchasing. Once they have selected an item they are prompted to submit the quantity of the item they are interested in purchasing.

If the user is successful in their purchase, the application will provide them with a total cost for their purchase. The user will also be presented an updated version of the inventory table which instantly updates the quantity for items based on recent purchases both in the client and server side of the application.
